![Alt text](Website%20Photos/200708-202502crdoilprice.png)

- **📈2007.8. - 2008.5 went up fast**
    
    From **August 2007 to May 2008**, crude oil prices surged due to **strong demand, supply constraints, geopolitical tensions, and financial speculation**. Key factors included:
    
    1. **Rising Global Demand** – Economic growth in **China and India** drove oil consumption to new highs through rapid industrialization and expanding transportation.
    - 1. India experienced one of its highest economic growth rates during this period: 2006—07 GDP growth 9.6%, the year before(2005-06) is 9.4%.
        - **1**. It’s IIP(Index of Industrial Production) grew at 11.5% in 2006-07: the services sector(especially IT+finance growing at 11.2%, the agriculture sector shows resilience with 3.8% growth). **2**. FDI(Foreign Direct Investment) surge: inflows more than doubled from 7.7 billion in the previous year (2005-06) to 19.5 billion!! Reforms in retail, infrastructure and telecommunications attracted major investment.—> Stock Market Bloom: BSE(Sensex) crossed 14000 in 2006.12, the market was fueled by strong corporate earnings, high foreign institutional investment. **3.** Inflation/monetary policies: Inflation averaged around 6% in 2006-07, Repo rate increased from 6.5% to 7.75% to curb the excessive inflation. **4.** IT growth: Infosys/TCS/Wipro expanding globally, infrastructure: highways and urban development(Golden Quadrilateral Project). The government had to raise interest rates to tighten monetary policies.
            
            
    - 2. China experienced High economic growth during this period as well, in 2007 China’s GDP surpasses $3.5 trillion, making it the third-largest economy( after US and Japan).
        
        2006 GDP grew by 12.7%, then 2007 grew by 14.2%, the fastest rate in over a decade.
        
        Investment Boom —> Fixed Asset investment surged: real estate, infrastructure, and manufacturing + government-led infrastructure projects and urbanization fueled demand for raw materials.
        
        Export-led growth —> China’s trade surplus expanded significantly ( demand mainly from the US and Europe).
        
        Industrial production —> heavy industries like steel, cement, and automobiles… + rising demand for electronics and machinery further boosted exports. 
        
        Rising inflation: in 2006-07 began to increase — with the consumer prices rising(pork and grain) by 4.8% in 2007, government had to introduce price controls on foold and fuel to curb inflation, and tightened monetary policies and credit policies multiple times in 2007 to slow excessive investment. 
        
        $$ Stock Market $ Real Estate BOOM:  Shanghai Stock Exchange saw a dramatic rise: with SSE Composite index reading peak in late 2007, Real Estate prices surged, prompting concerns over a potential bubble. — rural-urban income disparities widened. 
        
    1. Oil Supply struggled to keep up with demand. 
    - OPEC production limits - Opec maintained output restrictions;
        
        Declining production in key regions - major oil fields like Mexico and the North Sea were facing natural declines in oil production. Geopolitical risks - tensions in the Middle East, Iran/Iraq.
        
    - Geopolitical risks - tensions in the Middle East, Iran/Iraq.
        
        Back in **2006 and 2007**, Iraq was in the midst of a brutal insurgency following the **U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003**, which had overthrown Saddam Hussein. The war had shifted from a conventional military conflict into a full-blown **sectarian civil war** between Sunni and Shia factions, alongside insurgent groups and U.S.-led coalition forces. The U.S. military maintained a large presence, peaking at over **168,000 troops in 2007**. 	By late 2007, violence had decreased, but Iraq remained unstable.
        
        **Iraq and Iran have some of the world’s largest oil reserves.** The war disrupted Iraq’s oil production, but the U.S. and global markets remained highly dependent on Middle Eastern oil.
        
        •	**Oil prices were rising** due to instability in Iraq and concerns over Iran’s nuclear program.
        
        •	The U.S. had a **strategic interest in securing Iraq’s oil production**, though officially, the war was justified based on claims that Saddam had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs), which were never found.The U.S. was also concerned about **Iran’s nuclear ambitions**, leading to tensions between Washington and Tehran.
        
    1. Financial Speculation: From mid-2007 to mid-2008, 
    - crude oil prices **soared from around $70 per barrel to an all-time high of $147 per barrel in July 2008.**
        - investor & Hedge Funds —> US housing market collapsed in 2007, investors pulled money from stock & real estate and poured billions into commodities, especially crude oil! Oil became a “safe haven” asset, as inflation fears and a weakening US dollar drove traders to seek returns in hard assets.
    
    side notes about inflation:
    ![Alt text](Website&Photos/inflation_tpe.png)
    
    1. **Tight Supply & Production Issues** – Several factors limited supply:
    
    • **OPEC production limits** restricted supply growth
    
    • **Declining production** in major oil fields (Mexico, North Sea)
    
    • **Geopolitical risks** in the **Middle East**, particularly **Iran** and **Iraq**
    
    1. **Speculative Trading** – Investors **poured money into oil futures** as a hedge against inflation and dollar weakness
    2. **U.S. Dollar Depreciation** – The **weakened dollar** due to the **subprime crisis** and **Fed rate cuts** made oil cheaper for foreign buyers
    3. **Hurricane Katrina's Aftermath** – Recovery from the **2005** hurricane caused ongoing supply disruptions
    4. **Peak in Oil Prices** – Prices reached **$147 per barrel in July 2008** before crashing during the financial crisis
- **📉2008.5 - 2008.12 went down rapidly 📉**
    
    2008.7. hit all-time high H=$147barrel, then in 2008.12 hit L=$32/barrel.
    
    - Global Financial Crisis:
        
        global economic downturn —> demand for oil is closely tied to economic activity, expectations of a recession led to a massive drop in oil demand.
        
        <aside>
        💡
        
        oil demand & economic activity Tightly Linked:
        
        factories, transportations, traveling, more production and comsumption — more energy is needed, oil power is the core. therefore, during a recession or pandemic, demand for oil drops — ppl travel less, business cutback, shipping slows like during Covid-19, oil demand crashed, even pushing prices negative briefly!!!
        
        BUT: Efficiency Improvements, Electric Vehicles and renewable energy can weaken the link!!! Richer countries like the US or Japan use less oil **per unit of GDP** now. Link stays strong until energy becomes greener.
        
        Reversely: Oil prices can affect economic activity. High prices squeeze consumers and businesses with higher fuel and production costs, slowing things down. Low prices can boost disposable income and manufacturing, giving the economy a lift.
        
        - Oil Consumption Per Unit of GDP:
            
            barrels/1000 of GDP:  measures how oil-dependent any economy is and how efficiently it uses oil. over time, this should drop globally.
            
            over the last couple decades: about 0.01 barrels per year for over 35 years!!
            
            - 1980s, the world used about 0.7 barrels of oil per $1,000 of GDP
            - By 2019, this fell to around 0.43 barrels, and it’s kept edging down( a paper from Columbia University — tracked this linear drop.
            
            Efficiency Gains: cars/places/ factories uses less oil per mile — better tech like fuel-efficient engines or hybrid vehicles.
            
            Economic Shift: advanced economies like US and Europe have moved towards services (less-oil hungry) and oil heavy (oil-intensive)industries.
            
            Energy Alternatives: renewables and natural gas have nibbled away at oil’s share especially in power generation.
            
            **U.S. Example**: In 1972, the U.S. needed 1.1 barrels per $1,000 of GDP. By 2019, that was down to 0.4 barrels, and it’s likely hovered there or dipped more by 2025 as electric vehicles (EVs) and efficiency keep chipping away. This aligns with broader OECD (rich countries) trends.
            
            **Developing Countries**: Places like China and India still use more oil per GDP unit than the U.S. or Europe because they’re industrializing fast—building roads, factories, and cities. But even there, intensity is falling as they adopt better tech and policies. For instance, China’s oil intensity dropped from 0.8 barrels in 2000 to about 0.5 by 2020.

    - Speculative Bubble Burst
    - Falling demand
    - Strengthening US Dollar
    - OPEC delayed Production Cuts

- **raising interest rates impact:**
    
    when central bank raise inflation, they are usually trying to control inflation(ideally 2%) —>
    
    a rise on interest rate from central bank —> commercial banks deposit more in central banks(they earn more keeping their money in the central bank than lending it out) —>if they lend out, they will also raise their interest rate to make it worthwhile —>mortgage raise, less spare cash [even in NA, where people pay mortgage with fixed rate, still meaning mortgages will be more expensive]—> less spending overall [housing prices also decreases, people with properties feel poorer] —> business can’t raise prices —> businesses find more expensive to borrow and thus invest —> less economic activity —> fewer jobs —> lower wages —> less spending, investment, depress economy…. SO, to what extent? 
    
    inflation cause —> prices getting higher then employees needs higher wages —> pushing up costs for businesses —> spiral!
    
    sometimes it takes 2 full years to see the results from raising interest rates.
    
- **Exchange rates impact on exports/imports ( From US perspective):**
    
    in 2014:US import over 2 trillions of stuff including oil, cars, clothing… US’s biggest trading partners country is Canada, over 600 billion worth of goods/services.
    
    US worlds second largest exporter: high tech, medicine, media, jet tubines, generators and aircrafts, corn, oil and cotton. in 2014, US net export -722 billion ( trade deficit).
    
    Exchange rate: when the US imports more products from MEXICO, they exchange dollars for Pesos, therefore, increasing demand for pesos, peso appreciates, dollar depreciates. sometimes other countries may peg their currency to US dollar, Chinese gov, buy and sell US dollar to keep Chinese currency artificially depreciated. When US buy things from China, RMB appreciate, then CCP would turn around and buy dollars, then keep exchange rate same, keeping things cheap for US.
    
    In Accounting sense: Flow of goods and Flow of Money are symmetric! Sell assets to pay for the imports.
    
    US has very low savings rate, meaning it’s consuming everything it’s producing and sells assets to keep importing. Intentionally run a trade deficit.
    
- **Tariffs effect:**
    1. paid by the domestic company that’s importing the goods.
    2. counter example: 2018 washing machine case. to protect domestic washing machine, tariffs are imposed on the foreign washing machine, but this brought up the domestic washing machines and also the dryers(no tariffs added), then tariffs influence the price more than itself.(tariff elasticity of consumer prices >1).
    3. Another Counter example: 2018 steel +25% tariffs —> driving costs for domestic automotive, construction, machinery, despite increased employment in the domestic steel and iron industry, 2018 steel tariff cased a net reduction in manufacturing employment ( for each new hire in US steel, their were multiple layoffs in other domestic industries, meaning in the US, more industries use steel as an input of production than industries where steel is the output of production).
    4. Trade war in 2018-2019: **Farm Subsidies** – When the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, China retaliated with tariffs on American agricultural products. The U.S. government provided **relief payments to farmers** to compensate for lost sales. relief payment almost as high as tariff rev. But this is short term impact. Long term example —> in 1964, light truck had 25% tariffs added, since then pickup trucks and SUVs have become the highest profit margin vehicles for US car makers, serving as a lifeline for the US automotive industry. —> in 1980 foreign competitors to invest on US soil ( attracted Honda, Toyota,Nissan, Mercedes-Benz and BMW building assembly plants and created jobs)
